# cv-for-microscopy

This is repo contains the cleaned scripts of Michelle's work at NIBIB in the summer of 2021. 

Contents consist of the ANN and CNN approaches in their respective folders, as well as the relevant output generate from both models. 
*Note* that many earlier versions of ANN code were not included in the final repo, as they were significantly improved upon in later versions (```ann_approaches1-4.m``` and ```ann_approach_final.m```), which can be found in the "ann" subfolder.

See writeup for more details.
